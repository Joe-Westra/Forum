Looking at other forums, there seems to be a certain amount of people that have nothing constructive to say
but want to through their two cents in (like "this makes me feel _____ :)")
maybe each topic should have a garden for these people to leave their messages in.

There must be a language that would capitalize on the design of the forum the most.  Possibly room to create a new language?
